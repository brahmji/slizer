About
------
The most advanced and versatile open-source graph library for C++.

Apart from the basics (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Topological Sort etc), this package also contains implementations of a variety of very useful algorithms that are seldom found in other graph algorithm packages, such as Range Minimum Query and Lowest Common Ancestor

Misc
-------
  - If you want to contribute, just shoot me an email.
  - If you fork it, please keep this readme file to acknowledge my work on the project. For some reason China-jp's clone of the project (https://github.com/China-jp/slizer) fails to acknowledge that it is a fork
